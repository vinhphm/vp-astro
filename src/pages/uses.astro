    My tools of the trade and what I use to make things happen.
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="intro">
    I get asked a lot about the things I use to build software, stay productive,
    or buy to fool myself into thinking I’m being productive when I’m really
    just procrastinating. Here’s a big list of all of my favorite stuff.

  <div class="space-y-20">
    <ToolsSection title="Workstation">
      <Tool title="14” MacBook Pro, M1 Pro, 16GB RAM (2021)">
        I was using a Dell Vostro series notebook which is Intel-based prior to
        this and the difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn
        on a single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through
        with my various VMs and build processes.
      </Tool>
      <Tool title="Logitech MX Anywhere 2S">
        A perfect mix of functionality and mobility. I like so many things about
        it, and I know there is already a third generation model, but I am not
        ready to give up on the vertical scroll yet.
      </Tool>
      <Tool title="Apple Magic Mouse 2">
        Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with
        special powers. I really like feeling like a wizard with special powers.
        But I also like how the tradition mouse works, so Apple’s Magic Mouse
        seems like a best fit for my case.
      </Tool>
    </ToolsSection>
    <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
      <Tool title="Visual Studio Code">Can’t miss it, of course.</Tool>
      <Tool title="JetBrains Fleet">
        JetBrains Fleet is a fantastic editor. Though in preview stage, it shows
        much potential to be a good rival to Visual Studio Code.
      </Tool>
      <Tool title="iTerm2">
        I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren’t
        just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.
      </Tool>
    </ToolsSection>
    <ToolsSection title="Design">
      <Tool title="Figma">
        We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our
        virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected the
        collaboration features to be the real hook.
      </Tool>
    </ToolsSection>
    <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
      <Tool title="Focus">
        Simple tool for blocking distracting websites when I need to just do the
        work and get some momentum going.
      </Tool>
