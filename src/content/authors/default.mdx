## About this site 📝

Over the years, I have created many blogs but never had enough time to invest in them or stay for long. With **Vinh.Dev**, I aim to change that and have a little something of my own on the internet. This website serves as a blog where I share my thoughts, code, and experiences. The opinions expressed are my own. It also serves as a portfolio where I showcase my work.

The website was originally built using Next.js + Tailwind CSS. However, with the new version, which I call **Vinh.Dev ‘<span class="text-aquamarine-500">Aquamarine</span>’**, the website is now built using Astro + Tailwind CSS to ensure performance and simplicity.

### Credits

I learn how to build this site from these most awesome people and community:

- [Astro's official documents](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) for the details tutorials and guides for the migration from Next.js.
- [@leerob](https://github.com/leerob) for the Spotify implementation.
