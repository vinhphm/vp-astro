I'm a bit picky when it comes to themes, and to make it worse, sometimes, I can't decide between dark and light mode. Most developers probably prefer dark mode, but sometimes, I find it make my eyes tired. And then light theme are nice, but there aren't many options out there. The few popular ones are just too bright or too tanned.

Then, came [Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com)...

Just like the theme's homepage said, it's something beautiful indeed. And it's not just light theme, there are also two dark variants. What even more amazing is that, not only it is for your favorite text editor/IDE, you can use Rosé Pine for a wide-range of other type apps as well, they are all listed on the homepage.

Okay, so you probably already got some idea about how Rosé Pine looks in the light variant based on the image of the homepage about. Here is another sneak peak of one of the dark variants in Visual Studio Code:
