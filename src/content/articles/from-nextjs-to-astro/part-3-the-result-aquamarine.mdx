**Vinh.Dev ‘<span class="text-aquamarine-500">Aquamarine</span>’** is what I call the new version of the website. I won't lie, I kind of like Apple's practice of having a cool name for each release of macOS. So I want to do the same with my fresh start of Astro on Vinh.Dev.

> Aquamarine `/ˌäkwəməˈrēn/` is a beautiful blue-green color that evokes the purity of crystalline waters and the exhilaration and relaxation of the sea.

**‘<span class="text-aquamarine-500">Aquamarine</span>’** feels like new fresh air to my personal site. It's much simple, straight-to-the-point, and blazing fast.

That’s right, one of the main reasons I switched to Astro was its performance. Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. It uses a new web architecture called **Component Islands** that can optimize your site to load 33% faster with 90% less JavaScript using the UI frameworks you already love like React, Svelte, and Vue.

Astro also has a server-first API design that moves expensive hydration off of your users’ devices. This means that Astro can generate static HTML pages for most of your content and only load dynamic components when needed. This gives you the best of both worlds: static and dynamic rendering.

Another cool feature of Astro is its **Content Collections** API that provides automatic type-safety for Markdown and MDX. You can organize your Markdown and MDX files into different collections (like “blog”, “newsletter”, “products”) and Astro takes care of the rest: schema validation, SEO best practices, informative error messages, automatic generated types, inline type errors, autocomplete and more!

With Astro, I was able to create a beautiful and performant website that showcases my work and personality. I hope you enjoyed this series on how I moved from Next.js to Astro. If you want to learn more about Astro or try it out yourself, check out their [official website](https://astro.build) or their [documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).
