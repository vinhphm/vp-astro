title: 'From Next.js to Astro - Part 2: The Move'
summary: After finding out about Astro, I was excited for the move to the new framework and wanted to have a go with it right away. But things got harder than I thought. Here is what happenedâ€¦

At first glance you would think the move is easy, and it might actually be if your site doesnâ€™t have much going on. For my case though, it was a whole different story.

Let's start by taking a look at [Astro's document](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/) for the migration. They have all sorts of scenarios of which framework youâ€™re coming from, so I took a look at the [Next.js page](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/from-nextjs/)

Following all of those steps was kind of easy, you should find no troubles doing it in a simple static site. But some parts of my website did not work so well after the conversion.

## The header

My header has a specific animation and behavior. It will show itself when the user scrolls up. This once relied heavily on Reactâ€™s useRef and useEffects hooks. With the conversion to `.astro` file, I either had to convert those hooks and functions to the vanilla JS or keep those in `.tsx` file. The latter did not sound good, the header is always present on the site, I would rather have it optimized by Astro. It took me a while but I made it.

## The font

I use Inter variable font for Vinh.Dev. Since itâ€™s a variable font, the size of the font files are somewhat bigger than normal font files. In Next.js, since it has all been loaded in the first time you load the page, when you navigate through the site, you wonâ€™t see anything strange. However, thatâ€™s not the case with Astro, since almost anything in Astro is static. When you navigate through the site, everything needs to be loaded again, including the fonts. This can cause layout shift when your font of choice hasnâ€™t loaded yet but the pageâ€™s contents have already appeared.

The best way to avoid this is to have your font preloaded by putting this tag inside `<header>...</header>`

```html
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="{interVariable}"
  as="font"
  type="font/woff2"
  crossorigin
/>
```

## Spotify

If you have ever created a personal website with Next.js, you might have seen a Spotify widget on someone elseâ€™s site. I have one on mine too ðŸ˜Ž. It was probably inspired by [this tutorial](https://leerob.io/blog/spotify-api-nextjs) from Lee Robinson. Itâ€™s a cool widget, but you couldnâ€™t use it in Astro until version 2.0.0 came out. (Well, technically you could, but that did require another site to act as API Endpoints, and we donâ€™t want to complicate things up, do we?)

So in version 2.0.0, Astro supports SSR endpoints so that we can have all kinds APIs we want, and that means? Yes, Spotify ðŸŽ‰. So here is how the code for Spotify API looks like in Astro's way:

```ts
// src/pages/api/spotify.json.ts

import { getNowPlaying } from '@/lib/spotify'

export const get = async () => {
  const response = await getNowPlaying()

  if (response.status === 204 || response.status > 400) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ isPlaying: false }), {
      status: 200,
    })
  }

  const nowPlaying = await response.json()
  if (nowPlaying.currently_playing_type === 'track') {
    // song
    const isPlaying = nowPlaying.is_playing
    const title = nowPlaying.item.name
    const artist = nowPlaying.item.artists
      .map((_artist: any) => _artist.name)
      .join(', ')
    const songUrl = nowPlaying.item.external_urls.spotify

    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        artist,
        isPlaying,
        songUrl,
        title,
      }),
      {
        status: 200,
        headers: {
          'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=30',
        },
      }
    )
  } else if (nowPlaying.currently_playing_type === 'episode') {
    // podcast
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        isPlaying: nowPlaying.is_playing,
        songUrl: 'https://open.spotify.com',
        title: 'Podcast',
      }),
      {
        status: 200,
        headers: {
          'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=30',
        },
      }
    )
  }
}
```

We donâ€™t have a `handler` function with `req` and `res` cooked for us. Instead we have to define functions with the corresponding HTTP request type, then get the request and make the response by ourself. Actually, the Spotify example above is not very clear how can you get data from request's body. Here is another example how you can do it:

```ts
// src/pages/api/newsletter.json.ts

import mailchimp from '@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing'

mailchimp.setConfig({
  apiKey: import.meta.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY,
  server: import.meta.env.MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER, // e.g. us1
})

export const post = async ({ request }) => {
  let email

  if (request.headers.get('Content-Type') === 'application/json') {
    const formData = await request.json()
    email = formData.email
  }

  if (!email) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Email is required' }), {
      status: 400,
    })
  }

  try {
    await mailchimp.lists.addListMember(import.meta.env.MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID, {
      email_address: email,
      status: 'subscribed',
    })

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: '' }), {
      status: 201,
    })
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ error: error.message || error.toString() }),
      {
        status: 500,
      }
    )
  }
}
```

And also remember that the filename should include the data type your API will return, for example, `spotify.json.ts`

In my case, the component that uses the API is a `.tsx file. This means that when I want to use that component in some place in my Astro site, I have to call it like this:

```tsx
// ...
<NowPlaying client:only="preact" />
// ...
```

That has covered up all the big issues I encountered during the transfered to Astro. In the next article in the series, I will tell you how Astro made my website better than ever.

See you in the next one ;)
