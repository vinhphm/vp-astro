One of the few things I studied from Google UX Design course is how a good UX design should be fun to use. Google didn't exactly use the word "fun" to describe a good UX design, the exact word is **"enjoyable"**

> "If a product is enjoyable, it means the design delights the user. The design reflects what the user may be thinking or feeling and creates a positive connection with them. A product's design doesn't have to be enjoyable for it to function properly. But, an enjoyable design adds to an already functional product and can enhance the user's feelings about the experience." - [Google UX Design course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design)
> But what exactly are **"micro-interactions"** and how come they are related to this?

> "Micro-interactions are events which have one main task - a single purpose - and they're found all over your device and within apps. Their purpose is to delight the user; to create a moment that is engaging, welcoming and, dare we say it - human." - [UXDesign.cc](https://uxdesign.cc/micro-interactions-why-when-and-how-to-use-them-to-boost-the-ux-17094b3baaa0)
> Okay, so in order to maker my site more engaging and enjoyable, I decided to add some micro-interactions/ animation to it. I'm not planning to add back all the stuff that [I have got rid of](https://vinh.dev/blog/i-opted-in-a-more-minimal-design-but-why), instead, I'm going to add some small other thing. One of the big reasons I decided to simplify my website in the first place is this because animations seems not work correctly on some devices.

## Toggle menu (hamburger) icon üçî

First is the toogle menu for mobile devices from [UXDesign.cc](https://uxdesign.cc/the-menu-210bec7ad80c) with a little tweak from me:

<center>
  <Image src={menuToggle} alt="Menu toggle" />
</center>

I use React for my website but below is the plain HTML/CSS code shared by Mikael Ainalem from [UXDesign.cc](https://uxdesign.cc/the-menu-210bec7ad80c). I recommend you to check out his article on how this icon and animation is made. It's really fascinating.

```html
<button
  class="menu"
  onclick="this.classList.toggle('opened');this.setAttribute('aria-expanded', this.classList.contains('opened'))"
  aria-label="Main Menu"
>
  <svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <path
      class="line line1"
      d="M 20,29.000046 H 80.000231 C 80.000231,29.000046 94.498839,28.817352 94.532987,66.711331 94.543142,77.980673 90.966081,81.670246 85.259173,81.668997 79.552261,81.667751 75.000211,74.999942 75.000211,74.999942 L 25.000021,25.000058"
    />
    <path class="line line2" d="M 20,50 H 80" />
    <path
      class="line line3"
      d="M 20,70.999954 H 80.000231 C 80.000231,70.999954 94.498839,71.182648 94.532987,33.288669 94.543142,22.019327 90.966081,18.329754 85.259173,18.331003 79.552261,18.332249 75.000211,25.000058 75.000211,25.000058 L 25.000021,74.999942"
    />
  </svg>
</button>
```

```css
.menu {
  background-color: transparent;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  padding: 0;
}
.line {
  fill: none;
  stroke: black;
  stroke-width: 6;
  transition: stroke-dasharray 600ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1), stroke-dashoffset
      600ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
.line1 {
  stroke-dasharray: 60 207;
  stroke-width: 6;
}
.line2 {
  stroke-dasharray: 60 60;
  stroke-width: 6;
}
.line3 {
  stroke-dasharray: 60 207;
  stroke-width: 6;
}
.opened .line1 {
  stroke-dasharray: 90 207;
  stroke-dashoffset: -134;
  stroke-width: 6;
}
.opened .line2 {
  stroke-dasharray: 1 60;
  stroke-dashoffset: -30;
  stroke-width: 6;
}
.opened .line3 {
  stroke-dasharray: 90 207;
  stroke-dashoffset: -134;
  stroke-width: 6;
}
```

## Theme toggle icon ‚òÄÔ∏è/üåô

Second is the theme toggle icon from the top right corner:

<center>
  <Image src={themeToggle} alt="Theme toggle" />
</center>

This one I use React Spring to animate SVG icons based on the instruction from [jfelix.info](https://jfelix.info/blog/using-react-spring-to-animate-svg-icons-dark-mode-toggle) with another small tweaks from me to match with the current setup from my site. You can find the source code [here at GitHub](https://github.com/vinhphm/vinh-dev-archive/blob/main/components/AnimatedThemeIcon.js).

That's it for now. I hope you enjoy my sharing and if you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment below.
